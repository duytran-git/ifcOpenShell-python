# IfcOpenShell & Python
## An exercise of IfcOpenShell

### The task:
From an IFC file (BIM4EEB-TUD-2x3.ifc), make a dictionary of all walls (IfcWallStandardCase) that have windows (IfcWindow), each wall described with its
- GUID
- dimensions
- the total window area of the wall

### The result of the assignment includes two file:
- A report of the assignment, explain what results you achieved and how you did it. The format of the report should be a .pdf file;
- The Python code with the format of .py file.

### Requirements of the Python code:
#### The main part of the code should be wrapped in the main() function, for example:
def main(model_path):

…

return walls_with_windows

The input should be the path to your IFC file, and the output should be a list including all walls with windows with the required info. Walls without windows cannot be in the list.

#### The format of the output should be like:
[{'Dimensions': #dimensions from propertyset of the wall,

'GlobalId': #GUID of the wall,

'WindowsArea': #the total window area of the wall },

{'Dimensions': {'Height': #height, 'Length': #length , 'Width': #witdth }

#dimensions from propertyset of the wall,

'GlobalId': #GUID of the wall,

'WindowsArea': #the total window area of the wall },

…]


#### Abstract

The goal of this assignment was to identify walls in an IFC model that have windows a􀆩ached to them and to retrieve important information such as the dimensions, GUID of the walls and the total window area associated with each wall. I achieved this using IfcOpenShell with Python to analyze the IFC file.

#### Approach

#### 1. Opening the IFC model:

* First, I opened the IFC model file using IfcOpenShell. I used the by_type('IfcWallStandardCase') method to extract all instances of IfcWallStandardCase from the model, which represent the walls I wanted to analyze.

#### 2. Identifying walls with windows:
I wrote the function get_walls_have_windows() to loop through each wall and check for any windows associated with it. The process was as follows:
* I checked if each wall has an a􀆩ribute called “HasOpenings”. This indicates if the wall contains or
voids an opening.
* Through the “HasOpenings” relationship, I retrieved the IfcOpeningElement, which represents an opening in the wall (like a hole or void for a window).
* If this opening had fillings, I then looked for the “HasFillings” relationship, which pointed to elements like windows. When I found an IfcWindow, I knew that this wall had windows attached to it.

#### 3. Extracting wall dimensions:
* For each wall that I found with windows, I retrieved its dimensions: height, length, and width by accessing the BaseQuantities property set. If the wall had these properties, I extracted the values and stored them for reporting.

#### 4. Calculating window area:
* For each window associated with a wall, I extracted the area from the Dimensions property set. I summed up the areas of all windows attached to each wall and stored this total window area for later use.
#### 5. Storing and presenting the results:
* After processing all the walls and their related windows, I forma􀆩ed the information (GlobalId, dimensions, and total window area) into a structured dictionary for each wall. Finally, I printed the results for review.

#### The Relationships Between Walls and Windows:
* Walls (IfcWallStandardCase): I connected walls to windows through openings (IfcOpeningElement).
* Openings (IfcOpeningElement): These openings in the wall are typically voids where windows or doors can be placed.
* Windows (IfcWindow): Windows are linked to walls through the HasFillings relationship, which associates the opening in the wall with the window.
